## 📁 Project Structure

This repository contains a series of **ad-hoc SQL queries** categorized into different business problem statements. The SQL files are structured to be clear, well-commented, and easily understandable for both beginners and experienced analysts.


Each query addresses a specific business question and helps understand key areas like:

- Product performance
- Sales trend analysis
- Inventory insights
- Market penetration
- Pricing analysis
